### 10 Usability Heuristics for UX Design

**1. Visibility of system status**
- system should always keep users informed on what's going on through appropriate feedback within reasonable time
- *i.e. progress bar on a multi-page survey*

**2. Match between system and the real world**
- system should speak user's language with words, phrases, and concepts familiar to user rather than system-oriented terms
- follow real-world conventions for information to appear in natural and logical order
- *i.e. arrow key directions correspond with real world directions*

**3. User control and freedom**
- have "emergency exit" for users to leave unwanted states without having to go through extensive dialogue.
- *i.e. undo and redo*

**4. Consistency and standards**
- follow platform conventions so users never have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing.
- *i.e. use standard icons such as magnifying glass for search*

**5. Error prevention**
- design which prevents problems from occuring in the first place. Either eliminate error-prone conditions or check for them and present users with confirmation option before committing to action.
- *i.e. only allow calendar dates appropriate for response like travel dates only in the future*

**6. Recognition rather than recall**
- minimize user's memory load by making objects, actions, and options visible. Allow users to recognize their options rather than recalling them
- *i.e. drop down menu of options, autofill on search results or website names*

**7. Flexibility and efficiency of use**
- shortcuts and accelerators to speed up common interactions for both experienced and unexperienced users. Allow users to tailor frequent actions.
- *i.e. keyboard shortcuts for copy, cut, paste*

**8. Aesthetic and minimalist design**
- dialogues should not contain information which is irrelevant or rarely needed.
- *i.e. simple naviation bars, simple backgrounds*

**9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors**
- error messages in plain language (no codes) that precisely indicate problem and suggested solutions
- *i.e. no internet connection error message*

**10. Help and documentation**
- best not to need documentation, but when necessary make such information easy to search, focused on user's task, listing concrete steps to carry out, and concise
- *i.e. mouse-over descriptions about what a button will do*
