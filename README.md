### Digital Humanities 150 Assignment 1: Heuristic Evaluation by Ellen Mei
*“You think your pain and your heartbreak are unprecedented in the history of the world, but then you read. It was books that taught me that the things that tormented me most were the very things that connected me with all the people who were alive, who had ever been alive.”    ~James Baldwin*

Lately I have found a lot of solace and wisdom through reading in all forms and genres, and joy in discovering new favorite books and writers. As James Baldwin so deeply understood, reading is a fundamental and immutable means of human connection, and I hope to contribute to a shared goal for knowledge, understanding, and joy through reading. The community of English-language readers is diverse in background and identity, interest and motivation for reading, taste in reading materials, and accessibility to reading. In building a user interface that helps members of this community discover and access new things to read, I seek to promote reading materials as diverse as the community and as accessibly as possible. 

## Whichbook Heuristic Evaluation
[Whichbook](https://www.whichbook.net/)

Whichbook is a website that helps you choose a book to read through a unique process of searching by mood, emotion, plot shape, type of main character, and other parameters beyond genre, author, or keywords. The site focuses on books that readers will not find on other websites, excluding bestselling authors or already popular books in favor of less well-known books rated and contributed by real readers. Once a book is found, users can be linked to borrow or buy it, share it online, or add it to a book list.

#### Initial Evaluation
While the premise of Whichbook is very intriguing, the website itself looks outdated and confusing. The search function was difficult to understand without having to play around with the options and explore myself. The search results were disorganized and difficult to navigate. Examining how each result matched with my search parameters was cumbersome. Overall, my initial impression was that Whichbook executes its core search function poorly, and the first order of business was to resolve confusion and disorganization in searching for books based on unique parameters.


### 10 Usability Heuristics for UX Design

**1. Visibility of system status**
- system should always keep users informed on what's going on through appropriate feedback within reasonable time
- *i.e. progress bar on a multi-page survey*

**2. Match between system and the real world**
- system should speak user's language with words, phrases, and concepts familiar to user rather than system-oriented terms
- follow real-world conventions for information to appear in natural and logical order
- *i.e. arrow key directions correspond with real world directions*

**3. User control and freedom**
- have "emergency exit" for users to leave unwanted states without having to go through extensive dialogue.
- *i.e. undo and redo*

**4. Consistency and standards**
- follow platform conventions so users never have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing.
- *i.e. use standard icons such as magnifying glass for search*

**5. Error prevention**
- design which prevents problems from occuring in the first place. Either eliminate error-prone conditions or check for them and present users with confirmation option before committing to action.
- *i.e. only allow calendar dates appropriate for response like travel dates only in the future*

**6. Recognition rather than recall**
- minimize user's memory load by making objects, actions, and options visible. Allow users to recognize their options rather than recalling them
- *i.e. drop down menu of options, autofill on search results or website names*

**7. Flexibility and efficiency of use**
- shortcuts and accelerators to speed up common interactions for both experienced and unexperienced users. Allow users to tailor frequent actions.
- *i.e. keyboard shortcuts for copy, cut, paste*

**8. Aesthetic and minimalist design**
- dialogues should not contain information which is irrelevant or rarely needed.
- *i.e. simple naviation bars, simple backgrounds*

**9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors**
- error messages in plain language (no codes) that precisely indicate problem and suggested solutions
- *i.e. no internet connection error message*

**10. Help and documentation**
- best not to need documentation, but when necessary make such information easy to search, focused on user's task, listing concrete steps to carry out, and concise
- *i.e. mouse-over descriptions about what a button will do*
