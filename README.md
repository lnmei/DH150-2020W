### Digital Humanities 150: User Experience Design with Dr. Sookie Cho
### Assignment 1: Heuristic Evaluation by Ellen Mei
*“You think your pain and your heartbreak are unprecedented in the history of the world, but then you read. It was books that taught me that the things that tormented me most were the very things that connected me with all the people who were alive, who had ever been alive.”    ~James Baldwin*

Lately I have found a lot of solace and wisdom through reading in all forms and genres, and joy in discovering new favorite books and writers. As James Baldwin so deeply understood, reading is a fundamental and immutable means of human connection, and I hope to contribute to a shared goal for knowledge, understanding, and joy through reading. The community of English-language readers is diverse in background and identity, interest and motivation for reading, taste in reading materials, and accessibility to reading. In building a user interface that helps members of this community discover and access new things to read, I seek to promote reading materials as diverse as the community and as accessibly as possible. 

## Whichbook Heuristic Evaluation
[Whichbook](https://www.whichbook.net/)

Whichbook is a website that helps you choose a book to read through a unique process of searching by mood, emotion, plot shape, type of main character, and other parameters beyond genre, author, or keywords. The site focuses on books that readers will not find on other websites, excluding bestselling authors or already popular books in favor of less well-known books rated and contributed by real readers. Once a book is found, users can be linked to borrow or buy it, share it online, or add it to a book list.

#### Initial Evaluation
While the premise of Whichbook is very intriguing, the website itself looks outdated and confusing. The search function was difficult to understand without having to play around with the options and explore myself. The search results were disorganized and difficult to navigate. Examining how each result matched with my search parameters was cumbersome. Overall, my initial impression was that Whichbook executes its core search function poorly, and the first order of business was to resolve confusion and disorganization in searching for books based on unique parameters.

### 10 Usability Heuristics Evaluation

#### 1. Visibility of system status
*Severity Rating: 2*

Using the search process, although all search parameters are listed, there is no indication that there is a limit on the number of categories you can include in your search until you hit the upper limit of 4 categories. 


Once you click ‘Go’ to get your search results, there is no indication of how many books your search turned up. Notice in the screenshot that the scroll bar is already quite small, and the only button to expand the page merely says ‘More results…’.

#### 2. Match between system and the real world
*Severity Rating: 3*

The terms used to define the search parameters are somewhat intuitive to American English speakers, although some terms such as the idioms “larger than life” and “down to earth” can be confusing even to some native speakers.


Some categories of search, namely Race and Gender, are outdated compared to modern social conventions. Race includes only ‘Black’, ‘White’, and ‘Asian’ which themselves are vague categories of race, in addition to lumping everyone else together as ‘Other culture’. Gender features an acknowledgement of how it’s binary categories are antiquated but does not yet have a feature that addresses the problem.


Finally, when viewing the search results themselves, the blue links under the book synopsis appear to be external links as is convention for the blue and underlined text, but turn out to be pop-ups once you click them. The titles of the links themselves are also unintuitive and give no information about what ‘Extract’ and ‘Parallel’ mean in context.

#### 3. User control and freedom
*Severity Rating: 2*

The search function features a simple reset button for search parameters, and clicking on a selected category can allow you to deselect it and select something else, although figuring this feature out relies on the user experimenting by clicking around the menu.  

#### 4. Consistency and standards
*Severity Rating: 3*

This website uses exclusively text buttons for every feature, which makes navigating a bit clumsy. The search parameters are not labeled based on what they refer to or in any significant order, nor is the fact they are sliders made apparent until you click it. The sliders are unlabeled so the scale you are selecting by is unclear, and some categories such as ‘sex’ and ‘no sex’ are confusing as sliders since it appears to be a binary category. Additionally, it is difficult to distinguish the difference between category options such as the two pairs ‘expected’ and ‘unpredictable’, and ‘conventional’ and ‘unusual’. Furthermore, the site features buttons and links that do not give users an idea of what it does, such as the ‘Extract’ and ‘Parallels’ buttons. 

#### 5. Error prevention
*Severity Rating: 2*

The search function prevents you from inputting more than 4 categories with an error message that only appears once you try to click on a 5th category. Additional categories once 4 are selected are also faded and users are not allowed to click on them.

#### 6. Recognition rather than recall
*Severity Rating: 2*

All items in the search function are labeled so that users can easily select from predefined parameters. However, there is no search history that allows you to easily access previous search results, and previous results are difficult to replicate given the sliders are not labeled on a specified scale. Therefore, unless a book is saved to a list, a user looking for a specific book from a previous search must rely solely on memory. 

#### 7. Flexibility and efficiency of use
*Severity Rating: 3*

There do not appear to be any shortcuts or alternatives to the search process, including no option to revisit previous searches, although if the user has a specific book in mind, there is a ‘Find similar’ shortcut that allows users to easily search for similar books. However, there does not appear to be a search bar users can type in, so finding a specific title requires users to navigate an alphabetized list or titles or authors. Overall, this website’s primary and distinguishing function is the opposite of flexible and efficient.

#### 8. Aesthetic and minimalist design
*Severity Rating: 2*

Some of the search parameters seem to overlap and are therefore superfluous, namely the pairs ‘expected’ and ‘unpredictable’, and ‘conventional’ and ‘unusual’. The categories are not labeled so what aspect of a book they refer to –plot, characters, prose style, etc. – are unclear. 


The website’s aesthetic is sterile and severe, conflicting with the website’s self-proclaimed mission of being “a unique site for choosing what the read.” The About page is convoluted and long to read, as are the book synopses on a long scrolling page of dozens of search results. There are no images or graphics aside from small book covers. It is easy to get overwhelmed by text even as someone who enjoys reading. 


Additionally, many of the options, including the ‘About’ page are in a navigation bar at the bottom of the page, while the top navigation bar features only the ‘Home’ page and 3 separate tabs for Lists. Effectively, the design of the website does not fully communicate what the website has to offer. 

#### 9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors
*Severity Rating: 3*

A major error occurs when you try to remove books from your list. When editing your list, you are required to select books you want to delete. If you try to delete without selecting, the page gives you an error pop-up that tells you to select at least one book by clicking on the cover. However, why you try to click on the cover, you are unable to select any book. The ‘Select all’ button works to select books, and you can unselect a selected book, but you cannot reselect it by clicking on the cover. Therefore, although error diagnosis seems to work, the suggested solution does not.

#### 10. Help and documentation
*Severity Rating: 3*

The search parameters are unlabeled and using them requires the user to click around first to understand its functions, such as the sliders and the 4 category limit. There is no ‘Help’ page and the ‘About’ page does not give any usability documentation. Hovering or clicking buttons does not give information about what those buttons do.
