### Digital Humanities 150: User Experience Design with Dr. Sookie Cho
### Assignment 1: Heuristic Evaluation by Ellen Mei
*“You think your pain and your heartbreak are unprecedented in the history of the world, but then you read. It was books that taught me that the things that tormented me most were the very things that connected me with all the people who were alive, who had ever been alive.”    ~James Baldwin*

Lately I have found a lot of solace and wisdom through reading in all forms and genres, and joy in discovering new favorite books and writers. As James Baldwin so deeply understood, reading is a fundamental and immutable means of human connection, and I hope to contribute to a shared goal for knowledge, understanding, and joy through reading. The community of English-language readers is diverse in background and identity, interest and motivation for reading, taste in reading materials, and accessibility to reading. In building a user interface that helps members of this community discover and access new things to read, I seek to promote reading materials as diverse as the community and as accessibly as possible. 

## Whichbook Heuristic Evaluation
[Whichbook](https://www.whichbook.net/)

![Whichbook homepage](/whichbook/homepage.png)

Whichbook is a website that helps you choose a book to read through a unique process of searching by mood, emotion, plot shape, type of main character, and other parameters beyond genre, author, or keywords. The site focuses on books that readers will not find on other websites, excluding bestselling authors or already popular books in favor of less well-known books rated and contributed by real readers. Once a book is found, users can be linked to borrow or buy it, share it online, or add it to a book list.

#### Initial Evaluation
While the premise of Whichbook is very intriguing, the website itself looks outdated and confusing. The search function was difficult to understand without having to play around with the options and explore myself. The search results were disorganized and difficult to navigate. Examining how each result matched with my search parameters was cumbersome. Overall, my initial impression was that Whichbook executes its core search function poorly, and the first order of business was to resolve confusion and disorganization in searching for books based on unique parameters.

### 10 Usability Heuristics Evaluation

To conduct my heuristic evaluation, my task was to search for a book and add it to my list.

#### 1. Visibility of system status
*Severity Rating: 2*

![upper limit on search categories](/whichbook/h1%201.png)

Using the search process, although all search parameters are listed, there is no indication that there is a limit on the number of categories you can include in your search until you hit the upper limit of 4 categories. 

![search results](/whichbook/h1%202.png)

Once you click ‘Go’ to get your search results, there is no indication of how many books your search turned up. Notice in the screenshot that the scroll bar is already quite small, and the only button to expand the page merely says ‘More results…’.

#### 2. Match between system and the real world
*Severity Rating: 3*

The terms used to define the search parameters are somewhat intuitive to American English speakers, although some terms such as the idioms “larger than life” and “down to earth” can be confusing even to some native speakers.

![outdated search categories: race](/whichbook/h2%202.png)

![outdated search categories: gender](/whichbook/h2%203.png)

Some categories of search, namely Race and Gender, are outdated compared to modern social conventions. Race includes only ‘Black’, ‘White’, and ‘Asian’ which themselves are vague categories of race, in addition to lumping everyone else together as ‘Other culture’. Gender features an acknowledgement of how it’s binary categories are antiquated but does not yet have a feature that addresses the problem.

![links are difficult to understand](/whichbook/h2%204.png)

Finally, when viewing the search results themselves, the blue links under the book synopsis appear to be external links as is convention for the blue and underlined text, but turn out to be pop-ups once you click them. The titles of the links themselves are also unintuitive and give no information about what ‘Extract’ and ‘Parallel’ mean in context.

#### 3. User control and freedom
*Severity Rating: 2*

![search function](/whichbook/h3%201.png)

The search function features a simple reset button for search parameters, and clicking on a selected category can allow you to deselect it and select something else, although figuring this feature out relies on the user experimenting by clicking around the menu.  

#### 4. Consistency and standards
*Severity Rating: 3*

This website uses exclusively text buttons for every feature, which makes navigating a bit clumsy. The search parameters are not labeled based on what they refer to or in any significant order, nor is the fact they are sliders made apparent until you click it. The sliders are unlabeled so the scale you are selecting by is unclear, and some categories such as ‘sex’ and ‘no sex’ are confusing as sliders since it appears to be a binary category. Additionally, it is difficult to distinguish the difference between category options such as the two pairs ‘expected’ and ‘unpredictable’, and ‘conventional’ and ‘unusual’. Furthermore, the site features buttons and links that do not give users an idea of what it does, such as the ‘Extract’ and ‘Parallels’ buttons. 

#### 5. Error prevention
*Severity Rating: 2*

The search function prevents you from inputting more than 4 categories with an error message that only appears once you try to click on a 5th category. Additional categories once 4 are selected are also faded and users are not allowed to click on them.

#### 6. Recognition rather than recall
*Severity Rating: 2*

![vague search parameters](/whichbook/h6%201.png)

All items in the search function are labeled so that users can easily select from predefined parameters. However, there is no search history that allows you to easily access previous search results, and previous results are difficult to replicate given the sliders are not labeled on a specified scale. Therefore, unless a book is saved to a list, a user looking for a specific book from a previous search must rely solely on memory. 

#### 7. Flexibility and efficiency of use
*Severity Rating: 3*

![find similar](/whichbook/h7%201.png)

There do not appear to be any shortcuts or alternatives to the search process, including no option to revisit previous searches, although if the user has a specific book in mind, there is a ‘Find similar’ shortcut that allows users to easily search for similar books. 

![search for a book by title](/whichbook/h7%202.png)

However, there does not appear to be a search bar users can type in, so finding a specific title requires users to navigate an alphabetized list or titles or authors. Overall, this website’s primary and distinguishing function is the opposite of flexible and efficient.

#### 8. Aesthetic and minimalist design
*Severity Rating: 2*

Some of the search parameters seem to overlap and are therefore superfluous, namely the pairs ‘expected’ and ‘unpredictable’, and ‘conventional’ and ‘unusual’. The categories are not labeled so what aspect of a book they refer to –plot, characters, prose style, etc. – are unclear. 

![about page](/whichbook/h8%201.png)

The website’s aesthetic is sterile and severe, conflicting with the website’s self-proclaimed mission of being “a unique site for choosing what the read.” The About page is convoluted and long to read, as are the book synopses on a long scrolling page of dozens of search results. There are no images or graphics aside from small book covers. It is easy to get overwhelmed by text even as someone who enjoys reading. 

![bottom navigation bar](/whichbook/h8%202.png)

Additionally, many of the options, including the ‘About’ page are in a navigation bar at the bottom of the page, while the top navigation bar features only the ‘Home’ page and 3 separate tabs for Lists. Effectively, the design of the website does not fully communicate what the website has to offer. 

#### 9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors
*Severity Rating: 3*

![editing my list](/whichbook/h5%201.png)

![delete error](/whichbook/h5%202.png)

A major error occurs when you try to remove books from your list. When editing your list, you are required to select books you want to delete. If you try to delete without selecting, the page gives you an error pop-up that tells you to select at least one book by clicking on the cover. However, why you try to click on the cover, you are unable to select any book. The ‘Select all’ button works to select books, and you can unselect a selected book, but you cannot reselect it by clicking on the cover. Therefore, although error diagnosis seems to work, the suggested solution does not.

#### 10. Help and documentation
*Severity Rating: 3*

The search parameters are unlabeled and using them requires the user to click around first to understand its functions, such as the sliders and the 4 category limit. There is no ‘Help’ page and the ‘About’ page does not give any usability documentation. Hovering or clicking buttons does not give information about what those buttons do.


## Readgeek Heuristic Evaluation
[Readgeek](http://readgeek.com)

![Readgeek homepage](/readgeek/homepage.png)

Readgeek is a website that allows users to get book recommendations based on how they rate other books they have read, and using statistics and algorithms gives users a personalized prediction of how well they may rate a recommended book. Users can categorize books on their shelf and wishlist. Readgeek also functions as a social networking site in which users can find other readers who have read and enjoyed similar books.

#### Initial Evaluation

When I first started navigating Readgeek, I found the premise of getting recommendations by rating interesting but discovered that the site's way of giving users books to rate without categorization by genre or other traditional book categories gave me almost entirely books from literary 'canon', predominantly western literature, older literature, and books that I would never choose as representative of my taste. This was the only convenient way to rate books without searching for them individually, which was the first and most prominant usability issue I noticed. Ultimately I find that the website's usability is moderately effective but does not serve the needs and desires of many users, which you can easily see by scrolling through the site's user feedback tab.

### 10 Usability Heuristics Evaluation

#### 1. Visibility of system status
*Severity Rating: 1*

![rate books](/readgeek/h1%201.png)

When rating books, the page will always display how many books you have finished rating. You can easily see your stats for site usage from the homepage. 

#### 2. Match between system and the real world
*Severity Rating: 2*

![when we were vikings](/readgeek/h2%201.png)

The site seems not to give books that are new given its rating system and will therefore be unable to recommend more recent books (When We Were Vikings comes out this month). The site also does not feature less popular books in its results (Running with Lions, below). The site is therefore a bit antiquated and limited in the books it catalogues. 

![running with lions](/readgeek/h2%202.png)

In both cases, if a library system has the book the search will give books from the library and other sources for users to import.
For some reason sometimes while searching, although the site interface is all in English, buttons in the search result will appear in another language which appears to be either Spanish or Portuguese. 

#### 3. User control and freedom
*Severity Rating: 3*

![cannot undo rating](/readgeek/h3%201.png)

One error when rating is if you click to rate a book that you didn't intend to rate. When you try to undo your mistake, there is no button or option to undo a rating, no way of clicking around that undoes it, and trying to return the slider to the neutral position instead makes it seem that you rated the book 0/10. 

![book shelves](/readgeek/h3%202.png)

![book page](/readgeek/h2%203.png)

Additionally, if you try and edit your list of books to undo these errors after the fact, the process is a bit clumsy since you cannot edit books from the list interface itself and must view the book on it's own page to edit your interaction with it. From the book page itself errors are easy to undo and correct.

#### 4. Consistency and standards
*Severity Rating: 1*

The site uses icons that are pretty standard and self-explanatory i.e. a magnifying glass for search, a book with stars underneath for rating books. Links on the navigation bar and terms used on the site are standard and easy to understand for new users. The rating system out of 10 is familiar to users and using a slide bar to rate is intuitive. 

![typo](/readgeek/h4%201.png)

There are some small typos on the interface ('Fiend your first friend').

#### 5. Error prevention
*Severity Rating: 1*

![search results](/readgeek/h5%201.png)

When a search doesn't turn up any results from the website itself, the search either gives users the option or automatically redirects to other sources that users can use to supplement what is available on the website. This prevents errors of not finding most books that do exist but aren't listed on the site yet.

#### 6. Recognition rather than recall
*Severity Rating: 2*

![no search autofill or recommended search](/readgeek/h6%201.png)

The rating system gives you pages of books that you can look at and rate, which allows you to pick from a list of books you recognize instead of recalling ones you have read before. However, if you are searching for a specific book and use the search bar, there is no option to autofill the result and you must search based on a your memory of a book's title or author.

#### 7. Flexibility and efficiency of use
*Severity Rating: 3*

![feedback](/readgeek/h7%201.png)

Many users give feedback on this area in the feedback tab, such as asking for the ability to rate and like groups of books instead of just one by one i.e. an entire series like Harry Potter. 


Features such as selecting and mass editing books from your bookshelf are missing and therefore inconvenient in the case of wanting to add a group of books to a different shelf. Additionally, features such as creating a new shelf are missing, restricting all users to a predefined set of shelves even if those shelves do not fit a user's desired categorization system. 

#### 8. Aesthetic and minimalist design
*Severity Rating: 1*

The interface is overall easy to navigate and understand, not overly cluttered, and gives users necessary information and functions on each page. The background is plain and all important navigation is easy to find at the top of the page. If anything the aesthetic design is slightly outdated but not enough to be disruptive to the website experience.

#### 9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors
*Severity Rating: 2*

![mispelled query](/readgeek/h9%201.png)

The search function will display results close to a mispelled queries, but in some cases this might obscure results if the search misinterprets your input as a mispelling rather than intentional without giving users the option to correct the system.

![no recommendation error](/readgeek/h9%202.png)

If a user tries to get recommendations without rating any books, the user recieves an error message that tells uses to rate more books to recieve a recommendation and provides a link to go do so. 

#### 10. Help and documentation
*Severity Rating: *

![quick tutorial](/readgeek/h10%201.png)

When you first enter the website, right below the header with the option to start using the site, there is an easy to read explanation of how to use the website and what features are available. Most other things on the site are intuitive and easy to master just by using them without needing a tutorial.
