### About the Prototype

This prototype of the book recommendation and listing service **bookcore** showcases the keyword and category search features, similar search feature, and book listing feature of the website with high fidelity to the intended product. Building this prototype, I aim to get a better sense of where users have difficulty and find best usability using bookcore to make design and usability improvements, useful features, best flow, and most intuitive design. I built this prototype using Figma, designing all screens and components myself from scratch based off of my low fidelity wireframes and wireflow with improvements made based on peer feedback. 

This prototype allows users to:

* search by keyword
* search by adding category and keyword tags
* view search results
* search for books similar to a specific book
* look at book information
* add a book to a book list
* view book lists


### About the Graphical Interface Design

I decided to choose a cold-neutral color palette with yellow as an accent color. I ensured that my color contrasts adhere to the WCAG2.0 AA level standard of accessibility, and decided on a non-white background to ensure that users with difficulty reading on a white background feel more comfortable using this site. I decided to make the graphic design minimal and uncluttered, providing necessary information as needed but otherwise keeping the interface clean of extraneous information. I designed the interface to be friendly, with rounded buttons, and to resemble the interface of other reading apps such as news paper websites to make the website recognizable as being related to reading.
