# bookcore by Ellen Mei


## Introduction

*“You think your pain and your heartbreak are unprecedented in the history of the world, but then you read. It was books that taught me that the things that tormented me most were the very things that connected me with all the people who were alive, who had ever been alive.” ~James Baldwin*

Through reading and literature people are able to transcend boundaries in our empathy, understanding, and knowledge of others and the world around us. **bookcore** is a project in service of helping readers sift through the vast oceans of books to find the ones that resonate and compell us the most.

**bookcore** is a book recommendation search site aimed to allow readers to find books  beyond conventional labels of genre, title, and author, and beyond the literary canon and bestsellers lists. Through a tagging search system with unique categories including author demographics and subject representation, readers can discover their next favorite book from authors of gender and racial diversity, stories of more inclusive identity representations, unique and underrated books on specific topics, and more. Through this project I hope to show readers how boundless and diverse books can be and give publicity to more diverse authors.


## Design Statement

As a reader who intentionally tries to diversify the authors I read and find good representation in books of all genres, I find myself frequently searching for books that fit not only my preference in genre but are unique and diverse, most often turning to currated lists posted across various blogs that turn up from Google searches. With friends who are likewise motivated to find diversity in their books as well as find books to fit specific tastes, I thought that time and effort could be saved and reader desires better met by creating a means to search books by more unique, specific, and intentionally diverse categories. **bookcore** evolved from this motivation to create a way to find more diverse book recommendations.

## High-fidelity Prototype

[bookcore prototype](https://www.figma.com/file/SSAHuLPvOE0DVNXL1D5zS2/bookcore?node-id=0%3A1)

This prototype of the book recommendation and listing service bookcore showcases the keyword and category search features, similar search feature, and book listing feature of the website with high fidelity to the intended product. Building this prototype, I aim to get a better sense of where users have difficulty and find best usability using bookcore to make design and usability improvements, useful features, best flow, and most intuitive design. I built this prototype using Figma, designing all screens and components myself from scratch based off of my low fidelity wireframes and wireflow with improvements made based on peer feedback.
