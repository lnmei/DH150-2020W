# bookcore by Ellen Mei


## Introduction

*“You think your pain and your heartbreak are unprecedented in the history of the world, but then you read. It was books that taught me that the things that tormented me most were the very things that connected me with all the people who were alive, who had ever been alive.” ~James Baldwin*

Through reading and literature people are able to transcend boundaries in our empathy, understanding, and knowledge of others and the world around us. **bookcore** is a project in service of helping readers sift through the vast oceans of books to find the ones that resonate and compell us the most.

**bookcore** is a book recommendation search site aimed to allow readers to find books  beyond conventional labels of genre, title, and author, and beyond the literary canon and bestsellers lists. Through a tagging search system with unique categories including author demographics and subject representation, readers can discover their next favorite book from authors of gender and racial diversity, stories of more inclusive identity representations, unique and underrated books on specific topics, and more. Through this project I hope to show readers how boundless and diverse books can be and give publicity to more diverse authors.


## Design Statement

As a reader who intentionally tries to diversify the authors I read and find good representation in books of all genres, I find myself frequently searching for books that fit not only my preference in genre but are unique and diverse, most often turning to currated lists posted across various blogs that turn up from Google searches. With friends who are likewise motivated to find diversity in their books as well as find books to fit specific tastes, I thought that time and effort could be saved and reader desires better met by creating a means to search books by more unique, specific, and intentionally diverse categories. **bookcore** evolved from this motivation to create a way to find more diverse book recommendations.

## Competitor Analysis

[Whichbook](https://www.whichbook.net/)

Whichbook is a website that helps you choose a book to read through a unique process of searching by mood, emotion, plot shape, type of main character, and other parameters beyond genre, author, or keywords. The site focuses on books that readers will not find on other websites, excluding bestselling authors or already popular books in favor of less well-known books rated and contributed by real readers. Once a book is found, users can be linked to borrow or buy it, share it online, or add it to a book list.


While the premise of Whichbook is very interesting, I found that the website itself had a number of usability issues and an outdated graphical interface that made using the website unpleasant and frustrating. Most notable when conducting usability testing is the difficulty in performing some basic search functions using the website, such as when a user wants to find a specific book or author by a regular keyword search. The website lacked helpful documentation for users to learn how to navigate, was very inflexible and required quite a bit of time to get used to, and was outdated both in its graphical design and search categories, among a host of other issues.

## User Research

[My user research](https://github.com/lnmei/DH150-2020W/tree/master/assignment04)

In my user research I found that many readers will find book recommendations using other websites for books, the biggest being Goodreads, and by using search engines such as Google or by searching on Amazon. While there are many websites that give recommendations for books, and internet searches can also give recommendations, it can be difficult to find and keep track of literature that covers multiple specific categories that are important to a reader. People who search for books are readers of all ages and backgrounds and readers who are longtime readers looking for more diverse reading material and those who are trying to build a habit by finding books that will make reading most enjoyable. There are readers looking for recommendations for a very wide range of reasons and with very diverse criteria for picking books they like, whether by genre, mood, the demographic represented in the book, the topics discussed by the book, and many other categories. Users might do this activity anywhere they have online access for purposes of borrowing or buying a book online, or in locations where they have access to books such as libraries or bookstores.

## UX Storytelling

[User Personas + Scenarios](https://github.com/lnmei/DH150-2020W/tree/master/assignment05)

I built this project surrounding the user stories of 3 personas:

1. Adam the avid and omnivorous reader: a reader who reads a lot and often of all types of books
2. Cassandra the casual and infrequent reader: a reader who reads infrequently trying to build up a habit of reading
3. Pandora the picky and busy reader: a reader who reads when she can but is particular about the kinds of books she reads

With these different personas with distinctly different reading habits in mind, I built search functions of different levels of detail with various categories for search, a feature to find results similar to a specific book, and a function to save and review lists of books readers want to keep track of. To elaborate on how each persona would use and benefit from each feature, I defined a user journey for each.


## Wireframe and Graphic Design 

[Wireframe](https://github.com/lnmei/DH150-2020W/blob/master/assignment06/wireframe.PNG)

When building the wireframe and flow I made sure to design a flow from my key page types that would give users the information and results that were intuitive for what type of search they were doing. I based the design and features on what I had seen that worked on other sites such as Goodreads, and redesigning what I liked but didnt work from Whichbook. Ulitmately when developing my prototypes I made adjustments several times based on feedback and these changes appear in the difference between my low and high fidelity prototypes. 

Designing the graphical interface, I decided to choose a cold-neutral color palette with yellow as an accent color. I ensured that my color contrasts adhere to the WCAG2.0 AA level standard of accessibility, and decided on a non-white background to ensure that users with difficulty reading on a white background feel more comfortable using this site. I decided to make the graphic design minimal and uncluttered, providing necessary information as needed but otherwise keeping the interface clean of extraneous information. I designed the interface to be friendly, with rounded buttons, and to resemble the interface of other reading apps such as news paper websites to make the website recognizable as being related to reading.


## Low-fidelity Prototype

[My low-fidelity prototype](https://github.com/lnmei/DH150-2020W/tree/master/assignment06)

I built my low-fidelity prototype around 3 features:

1. keyword search: search by typing in the search bar
2. category search: search by category tags
3. book lists: keep track of books by adding them to a list

I found that my user had difficult at first understanding the search function just by viewing the screen but caught on after looking at it for a while. I found that rather than searching by keyword first when doing any type of search, my user would first go to the tags such as when looking for a book by genre, or searching for a book by a specific author. I learned that while preparing a low fidelity prototype, even though it is "low fidelity" a lot of specific considerations go into the prototype and designing the necessary features for each page to carry out your task smoothly.

## High-fidelity Prototype

[bookcore prototype](https://www.figma.com/file/SSAHuLPvOE0DVNXL1D5zS2/bookcore?node-id=0%3A1)

This prototype of the book recommendation and listing service bookcore showcases the keyword and category search features, similar search feature, and book listing feature of the website with high fidelity to the intended product. Building this prototype, I aim to get a better sense of where users have difficulty and find best usability using bookcore to make design and usability improvements, useful features, best flow, and most intuitive design. I built this prototype using Figma, designing all screens and components myself from scratch based off of my low fidelity wireframes and wireflow with improvements made based on peer feedback.

## Conclusion

Before going through this first iteration of user experience design process, I didn't realize how much research, interaction, and rounds of iteration it takes to develope a good user experience design, and how so many of the features I take for granted because they are intuitive have been evolved over time thanks to the work of designers who do this type of research to improve how users use technologies with graphical interfaces. The biggest take away from this process is how different the intentions and thought-process of designers can be from those of the user when using these designs. 

I previously approached graphic desigm from the standpoint of aesthetics almost exclusively so it was a good experience to learn and better understand the many other considerations that go into deciding the appearance and architecture of design, including accessibility and usability. Learning about how user experience design integrates with these and many other considerations and areas of design, product, and services has made problem solving in a greater sense more approachable as I think about the many different ways to make improvements to existing technologies or unsolved problems, whether on a small scale such as a single feature on a webpage or bigger issues such as improving antiquated and inconvenient processes such as applying to clear a criminal record or for other goverment and organizational services.
