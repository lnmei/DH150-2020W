# bookcore by Ellen Mei


## Introduction

*“You think your pain and your heartbreak are unprecedented in the history of the world, but then you read. It was books that taught me that the things that tormented me most were the very things that connected me with all the people who were alive, who had ever been alive.” ~James Baldwin*

Through reading and literature people are able to transcend boundaries in our empathy, understanding, and knowledge of others and the world around us. **bookcore** is a project in service of helping readers sift through the vast oceans of books to find the ones that resonate and compell us the most.

**bookcore** is a book recommendation search site aimed to allow readers to find books  beyond conventional labels of genre, title, and author, and beyond the literary canon and bestsellers lists. Through a tagging search system with unique categories including author demographics and subject representation, readers can discover their next favorite book from authors of gender and racial diversity, stories of more inclusive identity representations, unique and underrated books on specific topics, and more. Through this project I hope to show readers how boundless and diverse books can be and give publicity to more diverse authors.


## Design Statement

As a reader who intentionally tries to diversify the authors I read and find good representation in books of all genres, I find myself frequently searching for books that fit not only my preference in genre but are unique and diverse, most often turning to currated lists posted across various blogs that turn up from Google searches. With friends who are likewise motivated to find diversity in their books as well as find books to fit specific tastes, I thought that time and effort could be saved and reader desires better met by creating a means to search books by more unique, specific, and intentionally diverse categories. **bookcore** evolved from this motivation to create a way to find more diverse book recommendations.

## Competitor Analysis

[Whichbook](https://www.whichbook.net/)

Whichbook is a website that helps you choose a book to read through a unique process of searching by mood, emotion, plot shape, type of main character, and other parameters beyond genre, author, or keywords. The site focuses on books that readers will not find on other websites, excluding bestselling authors or already popular books in favor of less well-known books rated and contributed by real readers. Once a book is found, users can be linked to borrow or buy it, share it online, or add it to a book list.



While the premise of Whichbook is very interesting, I found that the website itself had a number of usability issues and an outdated graphical interface that made using the website unpleasant and frustrating. Most notable when conducting usability testing is the difficulty in performing some basic search functions using the website, such as when a user wants to find a specific book or author by a regular keyword search. The website lacked helpful documentation for users to learn how to navigate, was very inflexible and required quite a bit of time to get used to, and was outdated both in its graphical design and search categories, among a host of other issues.

## UX Storytelling

I built this project surrounding the user stories of 3 personas:

1. Adam the avid and omnivorous reader: a reader who reads a lot and often of all types of books
2. Cassandra the casual and infrequent reader: a reader who reads infrequently trying to build up a habit of reading
3. Pandora the picky and busy reader: a reader who reads when she can but is particular about the kinds of books she reads

With these different personas with distinctly different reading habits in mind, I built search functions of different levels of detail with various categories for search, a feature to find results similar to a specific book, and a function to save and review lists of books readers want to keep track of. To elaborate on how each persona would use and benefit from each feature, I defined a user journey for each.

## High-fidelity Prototype

[bookcore prototype](https://www.figma.com/file/SSAHuLPvOE0DVNXL1D5zS2/bookcore?node-id=0%3A1)

This prototype of the book recommendation and listing service bookcore showcases the keyword and category search features, similar search feature, and book listing feature of the website with high fidelity to the intended product. Building this prototype, I aim to get a better sense of where users have difficulty and find best usability using bookcore to make design and usability improvements, useful features, best flow, and most intuitive design. I built this prototype using Figma, designing all screens and components myself from scratch based off of my low fidelity wireframes and wireflow with improvements made based on peer feedback.
