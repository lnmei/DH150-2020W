# Whichbook Usability Testing

## The Purpose of Usability Testing

In this Usability Test for Whichbook, I want to test primarily the different search functions which users can use to search for books. Through my heuristic evaluation, I found that the most severe issues that I want to address are issues of consistency and standards, flexibility and efficiency of use, and match between the system and the real world regarding components of the search function. With consistency and standards, I want to test if the user, with a set of reasonable search parameters, is able to use the website's search function to reasonably address their criteria. To test flexibility and efficiency of use, I want to see if the user was able to navigate and use the website with more efficiency after doing a different search task each time, and where the user has difficulty using the search interface for different tasks. To test the match between the system and the real world, I want to test if the user is able to match their search criteria with the options given by the website's search function and where the user might run into difficulty interpreting their given options. In order to do this, I set up a set of tasks that requires the user to think about how to search with different criteria in mind: with a set of subjective criteria (mood, tone of a book), a set of objective criteria (the user's own identity including race, age, and traveling experience), and a specific criteria (a given book). 



## My Usability Testing Survey

I used [this google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScjKX0T_oYRlPlMeyCh8IA-tVHTIQBd-D7jDR7QQzuD3_rHeg/viewform?usp=sf_link) to record my participant responses.

## What I Learned

I learned from the usability test that users will often find ways to complete a task using functions that are easily understandable or that they already have experience using rather than searching for different tools to complete a task if the available tool doesn't readily solve their problem. Namely, the first function the user learns on the website will be the tool of choice for the user to complete other tasks. Tasks that required the user to start again from the beginning and spend more time seaking out other tools, specifically when the first tool wasn't fit for the task, proved to be frustrating, confusing, and difficult to complete. Importantly, I found that average users compared to heuristic evaluators do use the website very differently and may be much more task oriented than willing to explore many different options on a website, although this may be due to the testing environment rather than natural use, and now better understand the true value of usability testing. Overall, whether the user was able to complete the task or not, I gained valuable insight from their approach to an issue, since my participant was unable to complete one of my tasks. One thing I need to take into consideration in future usability tests is to make sure I am either giving tasks that can be completed without needing to Login, or otherwise making sure an account is logged in for the test. In general, I need to be more thorough while designing tasks for my users that allow them to adeptly complete the tasks properly without having extraneous and distracting steps or leaving the participant unable to complete the task by default. Additionally, I need to experiment with giving tasks with parameters that are either more specific or more general and flexible to account for the different approaches users take to using a service, whether with already specific intentions or not. My tasks were all specified and I found that the user would sometimes bend the task to fit their own approach to completing it with the website's function.
