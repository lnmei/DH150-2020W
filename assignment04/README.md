# User Research

### Main Design Challenge

With my project, bookcore, I hope to help users find book recommendations based on categories beyond just genre to find books in categories of character-type, plot structure, diversity, mood, and more. Reading is an activity for people looking for anything from knowledge about the world and self-actualization, to knowledge about themselves and self-esteem, to even discovering a sense of belonging with a community of readers or within the stories in books. Therefore, I hope my project, by diversifying the ways that readers can find books that resonate with their desires, can help more readers find books they want to read. 

Traditionally, readers can find books to read through recommendations currated or personally given by librarians, teachers, mentors, and friends. There are also many websites through which readers can find books by genre, by community recommendation and currated list, and by recommendations given by algorithms that use their existing data on the user profile. The most popular website is Goodreads, which is owned by Amazon, and other sites include Bookriot, LibraryThing, and Whichbook. While there are many websites that give recommendations for books, and internet searches can also give recommendations, it can be difficult to find and keep track of literature that covers multiple specific categories that are important to a reader (i.e. it could be difficult to find books about 'LGBTQ+ Asian Americans with happy endings'). This is a feature I hope to provide through my project so that readers can find specific categories of books and keep track of them to read later. 

### Target Users



### Research Method

For my research, I conducted a direct interview in which I ask my own scripted questions and engage in dialogue with my interviewee. I conducted my interview by inviting my interviewee to sit in a cafe with me and add a few books to her want to read list using [Whichbook](https://www.whichbook.net/), talk through what kinds of books she is hoping to find and how she feels about matching the search process to her desires and her results to her expectations. Throughout the interview, I would ask for clarification if I felt she did something interesting she did not elaborate on, and allowed her to ask me questions whenever she had any. 

While conducting my interview, my interviewee did not feel comfortable with being recorded so instead I took notes on my computer (I decided this because pen-paper is slow and difficult to read later), asked her to speak more slowly when giving answers, and repeat herself if I missed something. My notes on the interview do not include times when she had paused before answering or filler words such as "um," so the notes are not word for word but abbreviated to include only meaningful content.
