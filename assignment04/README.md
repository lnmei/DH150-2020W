# User Research

### Main Design Challenge

With my project, bookcore, I hope to help users find book recommendations based on categories beyond just genre to find books in categories of character-type, plot structure, diversity, mood, and more. Reading novels is an activity for people looking for anything from knowledge about the world and self-actualization, to knowledge about themselves and self-esteem, to even discovering a sense of belonging with a community of readers or within the stories in books. Therefore, I hope my project, by diversifying the ways that readers can find books that resonate with their desires, can help more readers find books they want to read. 

Traditionally, readers can find books to read through recommendations currated or personally given by librarians, teachers, mentors, and friends. There are also many websites through which readers can find books by genre, by community recommendation and currated list, and by recommendations given by algorithms that use their existing data on the user profile. The most popular website is Goodreads, which is owned by Amazon, and other sites include Bookriot, LibraryThing, and Whichbook. While there are many websites that give recommendations for books, and internet searches can also give recommendations, it can be difficult to find and keep track of literature that covers multiple specific categories that are important to a reader (i.e. it could be difficult to find books about 'LGBTQ+ Asian Americans with happy endings'). This is a feature I hope to provide through my project so that readers can find specific categories of books and keep track of them to read later. 

### Target Users

People who search for books are readers of all ages and backgrounds and readers who are longtime readers looking for more diverse reading material and those who are trying to build a habit by finding books that will make reading most enjoyable. There are readers looking for recommendations for a very wide range of reasons and with very diverse criteria for picking books they like, whether by genre, mood, the demographic represented in the book, the topics discussed by the book, and many other categories. Users might do this activity anywhere they have online access for purposes of borrowing or buying a book online, or in locations where they have access to books such as libraries or bookstores. 

To find a book by category, users might use a website or search engine to find the book by keywords such as "Asian American" or "cowboys" or "lesbian fiction". Users might view lists currated by others including on websites for book recommendations, view the pages of authors or book reviewers they like, use forums to ask other users for recommendations, view algorithmically currated recommendation lists, or web blogs ad articles. Finding books with very specific categories might be easiest through a web search or by directly consulting someone who is more of an expert in a certain domain such as a librarian, teacher, or friend.

### Research Method

For my research, I conducted a direct interview in which I ask my own scripted questions and engage in dialogue with my interviewee. I conducted my interview by inviting my interviewee to sit in a cafe with me and search online for books they want to read, talk through what kinds of books they are hoping to find and how they feel about matching the search process to their desires and their results to their expectations. Throughout the interview, I would ask for clarification if I felt they did something interesting they did not elaborate on, and allowed them to ask me questions whenever they had any. 

While conducting my interview, my interviewee did not feel comfortable with being recorded so instead I took notes on my computer (I decided this because pen-paper is slow and difficult to read later), asked them to speak more slowly when giving answers, and repeat themself if I missed something. My notes on the interview do not include times when they had paused before answering or filler words such as "um," so the notes are not word for word but abbreviated to include only meaningful content.
