# LoFi Prototype

## Project Description

There are many different demographics of readers and book lovers in the world looking for recommendations for what to read next. However, to find a great book that meets the desires of a reader is more difficult than it would seem as readers try to search for books that fit their taste in characters, mood, writing style, who the author is, and more. To address this challenge, bookcore is a website that allows readers to search through a commbination of both regular search by keyword and categorical tags including genre, author demographic and traits, writing style, character types, tone, and others. For frequent and omnivorous readers looking for a broad range of books to keep track of, to infrequent and casual readers looking for one book at a time, to busy and picky readers looking to quickly and efficiently find a specific type of book to read, bookcore addresses all manner of recommendation search user needs and desires through its basic features. 

##### Keyword Search

This feature is a search where users can type in keywords into a search bar that shows them possible search results in a drop down(i.e. typing "Celeste" might give you a list "author: Celeste Ng", "book: Little Fires Everywhere by Celeste Ng", "book: Everything I Never Told You by Celeste Ng", "book: Celeste (Gemini #1) by V.C. Andrews" ...). Users can click on a result to be search for that result or just search based on what the user typed into the bar (much like how Google's default search feature works). 

##### Category Search

This feature is a search where users can select items from categories including genre, author demographic and traits, writing style, character types, tone, and others. Users click to fill in check boxes next to items they want to include in their search criteria and recieve results in descending order of how many check boxes of that category apply to the book result.

##### Book Lists

Users can catelog which books they want to read by adding a book to their list from the book's information screen. Users can view their own lists on their own profiles by signing up to create an account and logging in anywhere to see their lists. Users can also create their own lists besides the default "want to read" list by starting a new list and adding books.

## Testing

In the image, each different color corresponds with a different task for a feature: red = category search; purple = keyword search; blue = adding to and searching list



I found that my user had difficult at first understanding the search function just by viewing the screen but caught on after looking at it for a while. This is an area I would need to improve by providing a tutorial or help. I found that rather than searching by keyword first when doing any type of search, my user would first go to the tags such as when looking for a book by genre, or searching for a book by a specific author. Then I found that my user once she recieved the book search result would not look at the tags until she had already looked at book descriptions and looked at other books, checking the tags as a supplement to the book information. When searching the list the user's first attempt was just to scroll through the list instead of taking time to conduct an extra search. Ultimately, the user completed all tasks efficiently with all 3 tests on this lofi prototype taking under 5 minutes. 

## Reflection

I learned that while preparing a low fidelity prototype, even though it is "low fidelity" a lot of specific considerations go into the prototype and designing the necessary features for each page to carry out your task smoothly. From testing I learned that although as the designer I try my best to optimize the features on my prototype, the user will still behave in a way that is, firstly based on familiar user behavior on other types of internet sites (i.e. scroll to search a list instead of using a list searching feature), and secondly that even if a feature is more common compared to another, a user will prefer to use something that utilizes recognition rather than recall (using category search rather than search bar for keywords which is a more common search function).

Based on this feedback, I would firstly provide a help or tutorial section for pages, especially the search function. I would also change the design of the list feature to make browsing a list easier and give less priority to using a list search feature.
