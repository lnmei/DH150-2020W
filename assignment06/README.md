# LoFi Prototype

## Project Description

There are many different demographics of readers and book lovers in the world looking for recommendations for what to read next. However, to find a great book that meets the desires of a reader is more difficult than it would seem as readers try to search for books that fit their taste in characters, mood, writing style, who the author is, and more. To address this challenge, bookcore is a website that allows readers to search through a commbination of both regular search by keyword and categorical tags including genre, author demographic and traits, writing style, character types, tone, and others. For frequent and omnivorous readers looking for a broad range of books to keep track of, to infrequent and casual readers looking for one book at a time, to busy and picky readers looking to quickly and efficiently find a specific type of book to read, bookcore addresses all manner of recommendation search user needs and desires through its basic features. 

##### Keyword Search

This feature is a search where users can type in keywords into a search bar that shows them possible search results in a drop down(i.e. typing "Celeste" might give you a list "author: Celeste Ng", "book: Little Fires Everywhere by Celeste Ng", "book: Everything I Never Told You by Celeste Ng", "book: Celeste (Gemini #1) by V.C. Andrews" ...). Users can click on a result to be search for that result or just search based on what the user typed into the bar (much like how Google's default search feature works). 

##### Category Search

This feature is a search where users can select items from categories including genre, author demographic and traits, writing style, character types, tone, and others. Users click to fill in check boxes next to items they want to include in their search criteria and recieve results in descending order of how many check boxes of that category apply to the book result.

##### Book Lists

Users can catelog which books they want to read by adding a book to their list from the book's information screen. Users can view their own lists on their own profiles by signing up to create an account and logging in anywhere to see their lists. Users can also create their own lists besides the default "want to read" list by starting a new list and adding books.

## Testing

## Reflection

I learned that while preparing a low fidelity prototype, even though it is "low fidelity" a lot of specific considerations go into the prototype and designing the necessary features for each page to carry out your task smoothly. I also found that designing a page that was both as simple as possible but not confusing took careful consideration about how to design the placement, labeling, and kinds of features on each page and how to represent them in the wireframe. 

Regarding the testing process, ...
